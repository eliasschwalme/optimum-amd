# AMD Ryzen AI

<Tip>

Ryzen AI support is work in progress and will greatly be improved and extended in the coming months.

</Tip>

The AMD Ryzenâ„¢ AI Software Platform enables developers to take machine learning models trained in PyTorch or TensorFlow and run them on laptops powered by [Ryzen AI](https://www.amd.com/en/products/ryzen-ai). Ryzen AI is a dedicated AI accelerator integrated on-chip with the CPU cores. The Ryzen AI software platform intelligently optimizes tasks and workloads, freeing-up CPU and GPU resources, and ensuring optimal performance at lower power.

Optimum-AMD provides easy interface for loading and inference of Hugging Face models on Ryzen AI accelerator.

## Ryzen AI Environment setup

A Ryzen AI environment needs to be enabled to use this library. Please refer to Ryzen AI's [Installation](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/inst.html) and [Runtime Setup](https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/runtime_setup.html).

## Minimal working example

To load a model and run inference with RyzenAI, you can just replace your `AutoModelForXxx` class with the corresponding `RyzenAIModelForXxx` class.

```python
import requests
from PIL import Image

from optimum.amd.ryzenai import RyzenAIModelForImageClassification
from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor, pipeline

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

model_id = <path of the model>
model = RyzenAIModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, vaip_config=<path to config file>)
feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_id)
cls_pipe = pipeline("image-classification", model=model, feature_extractor=feature_extractor)
outputs = cls_pipe(image)
```
