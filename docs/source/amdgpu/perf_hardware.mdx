# AMD Instinct GPU connectivity

When using Hugging Face libraries with AMD Instinct MI210 or MI250 GPUs in a multi-GPU settings where collective operations are used, training and inference performance may vary depending on which devices are used together on a node. Some use cases are for example tensor parallelism, pipeline paralellism or data parallelism.

## Dual-die topology

<Tip>

Using several devices on an AMD Instinct machine through `torchrun` on a single node? We recommend using `amdrun --ngpus <num_gpus> <script> <script_args>` instead to automatically dispatch to the best `num_gpus` available for maximum performance.

</Tip>


Let's take an MI250 machine for example. As `rocm-smi` shows, 8 devices are available:

```

====================================================================================
```

However, as can be seen on the [description of the machine architecture](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/instinct-business-docs/white-papers/amd-cdna2-white-paper.pdf), some devices effectively have a privileged connection and two devices (two GCDs, Graphics Compute Die) from `rocm-smi` actually correspond to one MI250 (one OAM, OCP Accelerator Module).

</div>

This can be checked by running `rocm-smi --shownodesbw`: some device <-> device link have a higher maximum bandwith. For example, from the table below, we can conclude that:
* If using two devices, using `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1"`, or `"2,3"`, or `"4,5"` or `"6,7"` should be privileged.
* If using three devices, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,6"` is a good option.
* If using four devices `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,6,7"` or `"2,3,4,5"` is a good option.

```

This table only gives theoretical minimum/maximum bandwidth. A good option to validate which devices to use together is to run the [rocm_bandwidth_test](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm_bandwidth_test) on your device.

## NUMA nodes

On certain AMD machines as seen in the figure below, some devices may have a privileged connectivity with certain CPU cores.

</div>

[4xMI250 machine topology](https://www.supermicro.com/products/brief/product-brief-Universal-GPU.pdf)

This can be checked using `rocm-smi --showtoponuma` that gives the NUMA topology:
```
==================================== Numa Nodes ====================================
GPU[0]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 0
GPU[0]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 0
GPU[1]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 0
GPU[1]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 0
GPU[2]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 0
GPU[2]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 0
GPU[3]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 0
GPU[3]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 0
GPU[4]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 1
GPU[4]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 1
GPU[5]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 1
GPU[5]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 1
GPU[6]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 1
GPU[6]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 1
GPU[7]          : (Topology) Numa Node: 1
GPU[7]          : (Topology) Numa Affinity: 1
```

and the difference in bandwidth can be checked using [rocm_bandwidth_test](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm_bandwidth_test) (redacted):

```

cpu0         N/A         N/A
cpu1         N/A         N/A
0            47.763      38.101
1            47.796      38.101
2            47.732      36.429
3            47.709      36.330
4            36.705      47.468
5            36.725      47.396
6            35.605      47.294
7            35.377      47.233
```

When benchmarking for optimal performances, we advise testing both without/with [NUMA balancing](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-en/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_tuning_and_optimization_guide/sect-virtualization_tuning_optimization_guide-numa-auto_numa_balancing) at `/proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing`, which may impact performances. The table below shows the difference in performance of [Text Generation Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) in a specific case where disabling NUMA balancing greatly increased performances.

  alt="Text Generation Inference latency comparison without/with NUMA balancing"

</div>

An alternative can be to use `numactl --membind`, binding a process using a GPU to its corresponding NUMA node cores. More details [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#numa-best-practices).

## Infinity Fabric

As seen on the below architecture for an MI210 machine, some GPU devices may be linked by an [Infinity Fabric link](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/infinity_fabric) that typically has a higher bandwidth than PCIe switch (up to 100 GB/s per Infinity Fabric link).

In fact measuring unidirectional copy peak bandwidth, we see that MI210 GPUs linked by Infinity Fabric can communicate ~1.7x times faster than through PCIe switch.
